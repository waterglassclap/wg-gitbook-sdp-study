# Architecture Quality Measurement

Performance, Scalability, Availability, Reliability, Usability, Maintainability, Reusability, Security, Manageability, Cost, Extensibility, …

## Performance

성능

**indication of the responsiveness** of a system to execute **any action** within a **given time interval**  
지정된 시간 간격 내에서 어떤 작업을 실행하는 시스템의 응답성

## Scalability

확장성

ability of a system either to handle increases in load without impact on performance or **for the available resources to be readily increased**  
성능에 영향을 주지 않고 부하 증가를 처리하거나 가용 리소스를 즉시 늘릴 수 있는 시스템 기능

## Availability

가용성

ability to not “500 Service not Available”  
**the percentage of time** that the infrastructure, system or a solution remains operational under normal circumstances in order to serve its intended purpose

**Percentage of availability = \(total elapsed time — sum of downtime\)/total elapsed time**

## Reliability

신뢰성

in performance**: the probability** that the system will meet certain performance standards in yielding **correct output** for a **desired time duration**.  
how well the service will be available in context of different real-world conditions

in data: after data updated, updated data should be returned.

## Usability

유용성

how effectively end users can use, learn, or control the system.

## Maintainability \(or Flexibility / Testibility\)

유지보수성, 유연성

the ability of the system to support changes

## **Reusability**

재사용성

A chance of using a component or system in other components/systems with small or no change.

## **Security**

보안

the ability of the system to reduce the likelihood of malicious or accidental actions as well as the possibility of theft or loss of information.

## Manageability

관리성

the ability to manage the system to ensure the continued health of a system with respect to scalability, reliability, availability, performance, and security.

## Cost

비용

Includes: hardware cost + software cost + management cost + deploy cost + **educational cost**

## **Extensibility**

확장 가능성

the ability to add additional functionality or modify existing functionality without impacting existing system functionality.
